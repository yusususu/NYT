# NYT Most Popular API Demo Project
This app supports iPhones and iPads running iOS 12.
Built with Xcode Version 10.1. Written in Swift 4.2.

This sample project initially displays a list of the most popular New York Times articles from the last 30 days. It enables users to search the New York Times API for articles, view details about each article.

One of the main motivation points behind the featured(popular) articles list was that they all contained thumbnail images which made the app look really nice on startup.

Also, after research, design, and writing the code, this project took somewhere between 6 and 8 hours.

I look forward to your feedback!
